This is a 2D Game with GPU based rendering (OpenGL3/GLSL).
Will focus on engine framework (rendering) first. Things I expect :
    - Large number of units on screen
    - Zoomable map
    - Dynamic lighting (with faked shadow casting)
    - 2.5D with fake height

Linux version only for now. But Windows will follow shortly.
